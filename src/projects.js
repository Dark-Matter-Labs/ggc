SCS is a natural process whereby CO2 is removed from the atmosphere and stored in a soil carbon pool. Carbon farming refers to a variety of agricultural meth- ods for sequestering carbon in soils. The Carbon Farming project taps into the potential of SCS by working with farm- ers and the food industry to define and roll out new farming practices, and to scale these up as “transformative cases”.

In addi- tion, extreme windstorms may be infrequent but they cause very large claims, which can overwhelm insurance and re- insurance companies.

Still, there is currently neither a systematic solution across Europe nor any direct link to the insurance sector.

It enables users to drive an electric carsharing vehicle the short distance to and from public transportation. ESPRIT is a light vehicle based on an electric quadricycle, which can be nested together and distributed as a road train of eight to ten vehicles. ESPRIT could efficiently complement public transport by compris- ing between 5 and 20 per cent of all trips, depending on the configuration. To address this potential, the system will go through various evaluations based on two demonstrations taking place in Lyon with 150 people.",

Enlarging the current centralised urban drainage and supply networks as a remedy is expensive and labour intensive. One solution can be Bluebloqs, a modular system for rainwater treatment, storage, and reuse. It combines biofiltration with aquifer storage technologies to achieve high treatment and recovery efficiencies. As a compact integrated system, Bluebloqs uses natural processes in a controlled manner, avoiding the need for large infrastructure. These small-scale circular water systems can be added to the existing infrastructure in urban retrofitting or development projects, enabling the transition to greener, cooler and water-resilient cities. This innovation was tested and implemented in a full-scale pilot application around the Sparta Stadium in Rotterdam in 2018. Four new demonstration sites will be implemented in different Euro- pean cities to improve the technology further and to provide a thorough proof of concept for its commercial uptake.",

The mobili- ty network builds on elements of the human-made land- scape: existing and renovated waterways, towpaths along- side canals, piers and bridges, cycle and bus lanes, railway lines and walking trails. A series of experiments are designed for citizens to experience new and clean ways of travel via water and land. Through an iterative approach and hands- on learning, the initiators of Landscape Metropolis want to understand how to make public transport and active mobility more attractive, incentivise people to permanently shift their everyday behaviours and reduce their car dependency.

          "The OpenSurface project explores new ways of monitoring land-use changes on the ground, such as deforestation. Cur- rently, most of these changes go unnoticed, and those that are noticed typically need to be verified by a person – which makes monitoring at this scale too intensive and time-con- suming to be practical. The OpenSurface tool applies new AI techniques to satellite imagery, augmenting this with drones, mobile device data and other sources where available. By connecting automatically verified changes on the ground to tailored alerts, or any digital service, the tool can drive the right response at the right time. Additionally, it gives stake- holders (governments, companies, individuals) the real-time data-base and transparency they need for effective climate action. This, in turn, enables new kinds of financial instru- ments and mechanisms. These can work across borders and industries to channel capital towards climate action, at scales – both large and small – not previously viable.",

          "This project looks into the sustainable use of phospho- rus. It is a critical raw material, as its supply is scarce and finite. Unfortunately, a majority of the material ends up as waste, causing damage to the environment and biodiversity. The Techno-economic and environmental feasibility study of Phosphorus recovery and reuse in fertilizers applied to Italian Prosumers is a project that explores efficient ways to recover and reuse phosphorus from waste sourced in the food industry. The results will identify the main barriers and drivers for change in this field and help estimate the eco- nomic benefits of improved phosphorus management at a business- and EU-level. By showing more concrete data, the study aims to raise awareness of sensible ways to shift to a circular economy of this material.",

          "Feeding the world has a tremendous environmental impact: global agricultural emissions grew by 8 per cent between 1990 and 2010, and they are expected to grow further – to 15 per cent above 2010 levels by 2030. By then, they will amount to almost 7 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases per year. In the animal production industry, for example, the ma- jority of emissions are caused by animal feed. The FEED-X project wants to improve the sustainability performance of the feed industry through alternative feed solutions, starting with the salmon and shrimp value chains, because to survive, they have to find a fish oil alternative. The central idea is to shift 10 per cent of the global feed industry towards more sustainable production, drawing on novel alternative solu- tions by independent entrepreneurs and their faster market adoption. These are chosen based on their ability to reduce harmful environmental effects from deforestation, high car- bon footprints and irresponsible fishing practices as well as food system circularity.",

          "The kitchen is a central place in the home for both cooking and social interaction and is renovated more often than the house itself. Previous studies have shown that premature alter- ations and replacements of the kitchen and its appliances lead to unnecessary material flows and high climate impact. The way they are currently made, sold, placed, used and discarded contributes to avoidable material use, environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The Circular Kitchen project develops easily adaptable modules made from high-quali- ty, environmentally friendly materials. This concept enables a kitchen design that can easily produce variants tailored to individual preferences, and that allows the continuous reuse of components. The high-quality materials cause higher initial costs, counterbalanced with long durability and much lower environmental impact.",

          "DryGro is an agriculture technology company that has devel- oped a new way to grow an animal feed protein ingredient called lemna. Lemna is a perfect supplement to the current industry standard for animal feed protein, soy. The proj- ect aims to tackle the global scarcity in protein ingredients for animal feed. This scarcity is currently especially acute in countries like Kenya, where it is difficult and expensive to ob- tain high-quality ingredients. Over the next few decades, this will become a much larger problem, as production will sim- ply be unable to keep up with demand. To increase soy pro- duction capacity, rainforests in Brazil might be clear-cut. The technology for producing lemna allows DryGro to address this problem in two ways. First, lemna can grow on arid land that is currently not suitable for crops. Second, it grows at a much higher productivity rate than soy – at scale, over 10 times greater per unit area. Thus, this technology can reduce demand pressure on local soy markets and limit the need for mass deforestation.",

Luckily, there is an increasing demand for more sustainable protein-rich foods like plant-based meat and dairy alternatives. The project Tailoring starter cultures for the production of meat and dairy alternatives from Brewers Spent Grain aims to produce plant-based meat and dairy substitutes with bet- ter taste, texture and nutritional value than currently avail- able substitutes. The products will be based on the largest side-stream from the brewing industry: Brewers spent grain (BSG), which is currently regarded as having low or no value. This will be done by fermenting the BSG, using plant-isolat- ed microorganisms to enhance taste, texture and nutritional value of the product in cooperation with the food industry. The project aims to develop a specialised starter culture for the fermentation of BSG by using and adapting carefully se- lected strains.",

          "Cities emit vast amounts of waste heat below 100°C. But exist- ing infrastructure only allows its use for domestic and industri- al heating applications – and not always. The efficient transfor- mation of waste heat into local and distributed electricity has not yet been feasible, but it would contribute immensely and immediately to a cleaner environment and systemic change in city energy. Converting magnetic energy into thermal energy is one way to harness this waste heat. Magnetocaloric materials heat up when exposed to a magnetic field and cool down once this field is removed. The project Local, magnetocaloric power conversion opportunities for cities aims to tackle a variety of challenges to allow the successful development, implementa- tion and commercialisation of a magnetocaloric heat exchang- er for cities. The project explores whether the current and ex- pected advancements in this technology would meet customer expectations, ensure profitable operations and have a positive environmental impact in cities.",
