SCS is a natural process whereby CO2 is removed from the atmosphere and stored in a soil carbon pool. Carbon farming refers to a variety of agricultural methods for sequestering carbon in soils. The Carbon Farming project taps into the potential of SCS by working with farmers and the food industry to define and roll out new farming practices, and to scale these up as “transformative cases”.

In addition, extreme windstorms may be infrequent but they cause very large claims, which can overwhelm insurance and reinsurance companies. Some governments and regions have funding mechanisms permanently in place to help restore forests after storm damage. Still, there is currently neither a systematic solution across Europe nor any direct link to the insurance sector.

          "In Europe, there is enough residual heat in to warm the continent’s entire building stock and plenty of solutions to cut reliance on primary energy sources and thus C02 emissions. District heating, for example, pipes residual heat from a city’s electricity production into local buildings. But its average heating market share is only 10 per cent. The Celsius 2.0 project aims to accelerate the energy transition by deploying smart and sustainable heating and cooling solutions in cities. Through its digital Celsius Toolbox, where stakeholders can connect, exchange ideas and foster innovation, the project supports knowledge-sharing and increases awareness of sustainable heating solutions. Celsius 2.0 also weighs in on European policymaking, supporting a legislative framework that empowers cities to pursue ambitious projects and policies that will reduce their carbon emissions footprint.",

ESPRIT is a light vehicle based on an electric quadricycle, which can be nested together and distributed as a road train of eight to ten vehicles. ESPRIT could efficiently complement public transport by comprising between 5 and 20 per cent of all trips, depending on the configuration. To address this potential, the system will go through various evaluations based on two demonstrations taking place in Lyon with 150 people.",

Enlarging the current centralised urban drainage and supply networks as a remedy is expensive and labour intensive. One solution can be Bluebloqs, a modular system for rainwater treatment, storage, and reuse. It combines biofiltration with aquifer storage technologies to achieve high treatment and recovery efficiencies. As a compact integrated system, Bluebloqs uses natural processes in a controlled manner, avoiding the need for large infrastructure. These small-scale circular water systems can be added to the existing infrastructure in urban retrofitting or development projects, enabling the transition to greener, cooler and water-resilient cities. This innovation was tested and implemented in a full-scale pilot application around the Sparta Stadium in Rotterdam in 2018. Four new demonstration sites will be implemented in different European cities to improve the technology further and to provide a thorough proof of concept for its commercial uptake.",

The mobility network builds on elements of the human-made landscape: existing and renovated waterways, towpaths alongside canals, piers and bridges, cycle and bus lanes, railway lines and walking trails. A series of experiments are designed for citizens to experience new and clean ways of travel via water and land. Through an iterative approach and handson learning, the initiators of Landscape Metropolis want to understand how to make public transport and active mobility more attractive, incentivise people to permanently shift their everyday behaviours and reduce their car dependency.

LIONS2LIFE is a pilot project that supplies clean energy from photovoltaic panels to an eco-neighbourhood by using end-of-use lithium batteries and giving them a second life. These batteries come from sustainable mobility systems, such as e-scooters, and are re-used instead of being recycled for their materials. This project represents a small but necessary step towards the vision of a second-life energy storage system in a sustainable district, built from batteries sourced from a shared mobility service",

Currently, most of these changes go unnoticed, and those that are noticed typically need to be verified by a person – which makes monitoring at this scale too intensive and time-consuming to be practical. The OpenSurface tool applies new AI techniques to satellite imagery, augmenting this with drones, mobile device data and other sources where available. By connecting automatically verified changes on the ground to tailored alerts, or any digital service, the tool can drive the right response at the right time. Additionally, it gives stakeholders (governments, companies, individuals) the real-time data-base and transparency they need for effective climate action. This, in turn, enables new kinds of financial instruments and mechanisms. These can work across borders and industries to channel capital towards climate action, at scales – both large and small – not previously viable.",

By then, they will amount to almost 7 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases per year. In the animal production industry, for example, the majority of emissions are caused by animal feed. The FEED-X project wants to improve the sustainability performance of the feed industry through alternative feed solutions, starting with the salmon and shrimp value chains, because to survive, they have to find a fish oil alternative. The central idea is to shift 10 per cent of the global feed industry towards more sustainable production, drawing on novel alternative solutions by independent entrepreneurs and their faster market adoption. These are chosen based on their ability to reduce harmful environmental effects from deforestation, high carbon footprints and irresponsible fishing practices as well as food system circularity.",

The way they are currently made, sold, placed, used and discarded contributes to avoidable material use, environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The Circular Kitchen project develops easily adaptable modules made from high-quality, environmentally friendly materials. This concept enables a kitchen design that can easily produce variants tailored to individual preferences, and that allows the continuous reuse of components.

          "DryGro is an agriculture technology company that has developed a new way to grow an animal feed protein ingredient called lemna. Lemna is a perfect supplement to the current industry standard for animal feed protein, soy. The project aims to tackle the global scarcity in protein ingredients for animal feed. This scarcity is currently especially acute in countries like Kenya, where it is difficult and expensive to obtain high-quality ingredients. Over the next few decades, this will become a much larger problem, as production will simply be unable to keep up with demand. To increase soy production capacity, rainforests in Brazil might be clear-cut. The technology for producing lemna allows DryGro to address this problem in two ways. First, lemna can grow on arid land that is currently not suitable for crops. Second, it grows at a much higher productivity rate than soy – at scale, over 10 times greater per unit area. Thus, this technology can reduce demand pressure on local soy markets and limit the need for mass deforestation.",

The products will be based on the largest side-stream from the brewing industry: Brewers spent grain (BSG), which is currently regarded as having low or no value. This will be done by fermenting the BSG, using plant-isolated microorganisms to enhance taste, texture and nutritional value of the product in cooperation with the food industry.

The efficient transformation of waste heat into local and distributed electricity has not yet been feasible, but it would contribute immensely and immediately to a cleaner environment and systemic change in city energy. Converting magnetic energy into thermal energy is one way to harness this waste heat. Magnetocaloric materials heat up when exposed to a magnetic field and cool down once this field is removed. The project Local, magnetocaloric power conversion opportunities for cities aims to tackle a variety of challenges to allow the successful development, implementation and commercialisation of a magnetocaloric heat exchanger for cities.
